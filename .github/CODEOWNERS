# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @isabelaranguren and @gPollux-64 will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
*       @isabelaranguren @gPollux-64

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies py files, only @py-owner and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
*.py    @py-owner

# You can also use email addresses if you prefer. They'll be
# used to look up users just like we do for commit author
# emails.
*.go docs@example.com

# In this example, @isabelaranguren owns any files in the tank-wars/docs/
# directory at the root of the repository and any of its
# subdirectories.
tank-wars/docs/ @isabelaranguren

# The `docs/*` pattern will match files like
# `docs/getting-started.md` but not further nested files like
# `docs/build-app/troubleshooting.md`.
docs/*  docs@example.com

# In this example, @aalund2013 owns any file in an apps directory
# anywhere in your repository.
/docs/ @aalund2013
